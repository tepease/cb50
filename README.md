### <a name="summary"></a>Summary

Welcome to the CB-CS Git repository. A repository is a place where project files and data about those files are stored. 

This repository - or *repo* - is the home of our curriculum. By the time you've worked through it all you'll be ready to build professional web applications in the CB *stack*.

No prior experience is necessary, just *sticktoitiveness*.

Except where otherwise specified, [course content is here](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/info) (except when its *here*), 
[Facebook group is here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1548876931792281/), [Slack chat is here.](https://cb50.slack.com)
 
Class meets **Thursdays** 12-1 in the CastleBranch Brewery and **Sundays** 1-4 at New Hanover Northeast Library in Watkins Room

### <a href="expectations"></a>Class Expectations
If you meet the below expectations, in the next 18 weeks you will go from zero programming experience to designing and coding your own desktop and web applications from the ground up. It is easy to defeat yourself by getting behind if you don’t stick to the assignment schedule - but you *can* keep on top of it and you *can* succeed. Coming to class regularly will help you keep on top of this a great deal - if you want to succeed you should come to as many classes as you can - at least once a week. Talk to [Tristan](mailto:tepease@castlebranch.com) or [Laurel](mailto:lljones@castlebranch.com) if you have a scheduling conflict.

* Assignments are due by midnight on Wednesday, to be reviewed on Thursday in class & on FB.

* Lectures will be watched outside of class time, prior to the date listed.

* You may need up to 5 out of class hours per week for completing problem sets and lectures.

* You will come to class with a laptop and headphones.

* Learning to program is hard! Don't beat yourself up when you struggle.
