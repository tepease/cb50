### Project 1

We struggled a little last week. This week we're going to struggle a little more. Remember not to be hard on yourself if you're struggling! Take a break if you're getting frustrated and think through the steps you're taking. If you come back, leave, and come back a few times and can't make progress, ask a friend or mentor for help. Struggling, getting help, and understanding what you were missing is how we learn :] 

#### Part 0: Git Stylish

We added our motivation last week in motivation.txt.

If Tristan remembered to change it, you may notice that motivation.txt is now gone! (from the projects/0/ directory) t's been replaced by motivation.md.
A .md file is the same as a .txt, with the additional feature that git *renders* certain character patterns as styling.
Add some flair of your own to your motivation!

##### Requirements

* Check out this primer on [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

* In your console/command line/bash, navigate to your cb50 repository just like you did last week (starts with ```cd ~```, remember?)

* Switch to the master branch, where I merge the latest changes at the origin (```git checkout master```) 

* Run ```git status```. Is your master branch up to date?

* If not, pull down the changes with ```git pull origin master```

* Create a new branch for your styling changes. Remember how? Reference the instructions from Project 0 if you're stuck! 

* Now open up motivation.md and incorporate 1 or more elements of markdown styling into your motivation

Note that you won't be able to see your changes in a simple text editor - you'll have to push them up to github to see them for now.

* ```git diff``` to make sure no unexpected changes wre made to other files being tracked by git.

* Commit your changes to the new branch, with ```git commit -am 'Tell what you did in a few words'``` just like before

* Send your updates up to our origin repository with ```git push origin motivation-styling```

* And then refer to last week's instructions for creating a pull request for me to merge 

Awesome work!
