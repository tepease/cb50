### Project 1

#### Part 0: Git Stylish

We added our motivation last week in motivation.txt.

If Tristan remembered to change it, you may notice that motivation.txt is now gone! It's been replaced by motivation.md.
If you look at the file in the browser, however, you'll notice that nothing has changed. What's up with that?
This is because the extension, or suffix, on any file does nothing to change its content, and GitHub always displays the raw content of a file.
You can test this by finding an image file on your computer and changing it's suffix from .png or .jpg (or anything) to .txt.
Double click it to open. What do you see? Now change it back to the image suffix it started as and double click it.

As you can see, the data wasn't changed at all... but the way your computer decided to handle it did. 
your computer saw the .txt and looked through a file where it stores all the suffixes it knows, and the applications it has installed that can open them.
