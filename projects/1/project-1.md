### Project 1

#### Part 0: Git Stylish

We added our motivation last week in motivation.txt.

If Tristan remembered to change it, you may notice that motivation.txt is now gone! It's been replaced by motivation.md.
A .md file is the same as a .txt, with the additional feature that git *renders* certain character patterns as styling.
Add some flair of your own to your motivation!

##### Requirements

* Check out this primer on [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

* In your console/command line/bash, navigate to your cb50 repository just like you did last week (starts with ```cd ~```, remember?)

* Checkout the master branch (```git checkout master```) 

* Run ```git status```. Is your master branch up to date?

* If not, pull down the changes with ```git pull origin master```

* 

* Now open up motivation.md and incorporate 1 or more elements of markdown styling into your motivation

Note that you won't be able to see your changes in a simple text editor - you'll have to push them up to github to see them for now.
Refer to last week's instructions for completing the push to github and creating a pull request.
