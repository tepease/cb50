### *Adding that S.T.Y.L.E*   

More than ever, I want to stay 
## *Motivated*.   
Watching the Lectures, repeating the Shorts (over and over), taking a bajillion notes, and  
finally implementing the respective concepts has been nothing short of frustrating.

I say *frustrating*, when I actually mean *humbling.*
   
I always appreciated the work it took engineering to develop and produce movies, games, apps, etc... but I never fully grasped just how much   
went into seeing a project through to fruition.

What we are capable of is incredible.
Suffice it to say, I am more than excited to continue on this journey. :sunglasses:

------
What I hope to gain from this course is versatility. I wish to acquire knowledge that I never dreamed of possessing.
To create a program from symbols and seemingly random texts, I imagine, feels like a child lacing up their shoes
for the first time.   
I want to feel accomplished.

I am really excited to look back to day 1 and understand all this stuff that is currently *mind blowing*!  :)  


I am looking forward to **retraining my brain** back to looking at and understanding code, it has been forever!  I want to keep growing and learning and eventually create my own App one day. 


Oh and have fun and make new friends along the way!
