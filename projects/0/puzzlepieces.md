As you play around with your Scratch project, think about what each different type of puzzle piece is doing. 
In your own words, describe the behavior of the following 'control' pieces:

* forever

* repeat

* if then

* if then else

* repeat until

As well as 

* the 'data' variable pieces

After writing these up, submit them to me via email or chat by 7pm Tuesday evening.
