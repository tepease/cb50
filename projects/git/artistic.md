### Project 2 

Lets go to the git gym and flex our git skills! ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ 

#### Requirements

* Add some text based emoji to emoji.md, and send me a pull request when you're done

In order to do this you'll need to rely on the git workflow we've been starting to establish:

0.  ```cd``` to your repo

1.  ```git checkout master```

2.  ```git pull origin master```

3.  ```git branch my-branch-name```

4.  ```git checkout my-branch-name```

5.  edit and save your files

6.  ```git commit -am 'your commit message'```

7.  ```git push origin my-branch-name```

8.  go to the origin repo in your browser, locate your branch, and create a pull request

If you get any errors that don't make sense, don't suffer - send them my way in Slack!
