##### Setup

* Sign up for an account on MIT's [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) site.

You can use some of these resources to get started, or just dive in if you're a already somewhat comfortable with the concepts.

##### Resources

First, the best resource you'll ever have when programming - [help documentation](https://scratch.mit.edu/help/). 
This can take many different forms, as you saw from the 'man' pages in git. 
Help docs are almost always the most *reliable*, *up-to-date* resource you'll have access to.
In many cases understanding help docs can be a skill all its own... but its a skill worth honing!

Don't worry though, you're not stuck with just the help pages today! You can also use:

* CS50 [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/697pD31GCZg) from Zamyla 

* [Scratch getting started guide](https://cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__95f8025b5d5663c8eca07b96a66ef8d6__/pdfs/help/Getting-Started-Guide-Scratch2.pdf)

If you want to find more audio assets to use in your project, you may want to try [FreeSound](http://www.freesound.org/)

For image assets, you can run any Google image search and click **tools**, **usage rights** to find images labelled for reuse or noncommercial reuse.

##### Requirements

In order to complete this project you'll have 

Your mission is, quite simply, to have fun with Scratch and implement a project of your choice (be it an animation, a game, interactive art, or anything else), subject only to the following requirements.

* Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.

* Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).

* Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.

* Your project must use at least one sound.

Once finished with your project, click See project page in Scratch’s top-right corner. 
Ensure your project has a title (in Scratch’s top-left corner), some instructions (in Scratch’s top-right corner), 
and some notes and/or credits (in Scratch’s bottom-right corner). 
Then click Share in Scratch’s top-right corner so that others can see your project. 
Finally, take note of the URL in your browser’s address bar. That’s your project’s URL on MIT’s website, 
and you’ll need to know it later.


#### <a name='puzzlepieces'></a> puzzle pieces

As you play around with your Scratch project, think about what each different type of puzzle piece is doing. 
In your own words, describe the behavior of the following 'control' pieces:

* forever

* repeat

* if then

* if then else

* repeat until

As well as 

* the 'data' variable pieces

After writing these up, submit them to me via email or chat by 7pm Tuesday evening.
